## Analysis steps
The output in the file UCIHAR_average is created by running the run_analysis.R file using the raw UCI HAR dataset.
No other processing steps have been taken.

## Data
The data comes from the UCI HAR dataset

## Non-measurements meta-data
- subject      
 
 The participant that performed the activities. There are 30 participants
- activity  

 The activity the participant performed; one of walking, sitting, laying, standing, walking upwards, walking downwards
